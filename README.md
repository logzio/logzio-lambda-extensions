# Logzio-lambda-extensions

Lambda extensions enable tools to integrate deeply into the Lambda execution environment to control and participate in Lambdaâ€™s lifecycle.
To read more about Lambda Extensions, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html).  
The Logz.io Lambda extension for logs, uses the AWS Extensions API and [AWS Logs API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-logs-api.html), and sends your Lambda Function Logs directly to your Logz.io account.

This repo is based on the [AWS lambda extensions sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-extensions/tree/main/python-example-logs-api-extension/extensions).
